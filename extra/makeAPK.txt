Building a release APK
This section describes how to build a release APK. If you completed the signing steps in the previous section, the release APK will be signed.

Using the command line:

cd <app dir> (replace <app dir> with your applicationâ€™s directory).
Run flutter build apk (flutter build defaults to --release).
The release APK for your app is created at <app dir>/build/app/outputs/apk/app-release.apk.

Installing a release APK on a device
Follow these steps to install the APK built in the previous step on a connected Android device.

Using the command line:

Connect your Android device to your computer with a USB cable.
cd <app dir> where <app dir> is your application directory.
Run flutter install .
