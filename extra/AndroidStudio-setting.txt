IN CMD for making without signed release APK

a) Make sure that the environment variables are set correctly,
If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the PATH environment variable:

From the Start search bar, type ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account
Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
If the entry does exist, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
If the entry does not exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.
Note that you will have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect.

i.e. - use Reboot your computer after add path giving any issue
