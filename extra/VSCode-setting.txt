1) Make sure that the environment variables are set correctly,
Go to “Control Panel > User Accounts > User Accounts > Change my environment variables”
Under “User variables” check if there is an entry called “Path”: (i.e. - flutter env path.png)
 a) set Flutter SDK Path - E:\Software\AndroidStudio\flutter_windows_v1.5.4-hotfix.2-stable\flutter\bin;
		If the entry does exist, append the full path to flutter\bin using  ; as a separator from existing values.
 b) set Android SDK path - E:\Software\AndroidStudio\SDK
 c) if need set GIThub path too - C:\Program Files\Git\git-cmd.exe

2) Reboot your computer - then only flutter docker work in CMD.

3) Setup flutter VScode Extension as shown - (i.e. -flutter VScode extension.png)

4) Connect ADB Device - Using Mobile phone via USB or run Android Emulator via Android Studio then check.

Manage your Flutter app development.

Common commands:

  flutter create <output directory>
    Create a new Flutter project in the specified directory.

  flutter run [options]
    Run your Flutter application on an attached device or in an emulator.

Usage: flutter <command> [arguments]

Global options:
-h, --help                     Print this usage information.
-v, --verbose                  Noisy logging, including all shell commands executed.
                               If used with --help, shows hidden options.

    --quiet                    Reduce the amount of output from some commands.
    --[no-]wrap                Toggles output word wrapping, regardless of whether or not the output is a terminal.
                               (defaults to on)

    --wrap-column              Sets the output wrap column. If not set, uses the width of the terminal. No wrapping
                               occurs if not writing to a terminal. Use --no-wrap to turn off wrapping when connected to
                               a terminal.

-d, --device-id                Target device id or name (prefixes allowed).
    --version                  Reports the version of this tool.
    --machine                  When used with the --version flag, outputs the information using JSON.
    --[no-]color               Whether to use terminal colors (requires support for ANSI escape sequences).
                               (defaults to on)

    --[no-]version-check       Allow Flutter to check for updates when this command runs.
                               (defaults to on)

    --suppress-analytics       Suppress analytics reporting when this command runs.
    --bug-report               Captures a bug report file to submit to the Flutter team.
                               Contains local paths, device identifiers, and log snippets.

    --packages                 Path to your ".packages" file.
                               (required, since the current directory does not contain a ".packages" file)

    --flutter-root             The root directory of the Flutter repository.
                               Defaults to $FLUTTER_ROOT if set, otherwise uses the parent of the directory that the
                               "flutter" script itself is in.

Local build selection options (not normally required):
    --local-engine-src-path    Path to your engine src directory, if you are building Flutter locally.
                               Defaults to $FLUTTER_ENGINE if set, otherwise defaults to the path given in your
                               pubspec.yaml dependency_overrides for sky_engine, if any, or, failing that, tries to
                               guess at the location based on the value of the --flutter-root option.

    --local-engine             Name of a build output within the engine out directory, if you are building Flutter
                               locally.
                               Use this to select a specific version of the engine if you have built multiple engine
                               targets.
                               This path is relative to --local-engine-src-path/out.

Options for testing the "flutter" tool itself:
    --record-to                Enables recording of process invocations (including stdout and stderr of all such
                               invocations), and file system access (reads and writes).
                               Serializes that recording to a directory with the path specified in this flag. If the
                               directory does not already exist, it will be created.

    --replay-from              Enables mocking of process invocations by replaying their stdout, stderr, and exit code
                               from the specified recording (obtained via --record-to). The path specified in this flag
                               must refer to a directory that holds serialized process invocations structured according
                               to the output of --record-to.

    --show-test-device         List the special 'flutter-tester' device in device listings. This headless device is used
                               to
                               test Flutter tooling.
